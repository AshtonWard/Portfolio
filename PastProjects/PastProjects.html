                <p class="card-text">So I imaged an old windows 10 laptop to a Kali Linux machine. I did
                    this so I could have the experience of imaging a machine with a free mind, adding and

                    Hello, I am Ashton Ward. This will be the first input on my home lab. I am very late on
                    starting this report so the details are very limited as I have forgotten a few things
